# Summary

A lot of these papers are really well deployed already and being used
in real world. Some of the important ideas learnt include :

* Using data-driven analysis to arrive at the optimal value of TCP's
  initial congestion window and supporting those decisions with
  justifications based on domain knowledge.

* Re-factoring and abstracting TCP Congestion algorithms such that
  they are easier to reason about and novel mathematically "tractable"
  algorithms can be proposed on top of such a model. Separation of
  concerns related to transmission scheduling and TCP congestion
  control is especially helpful as described in "Laminar TCP"

* A novel hybrid approach to TCP congestion control that adjusts its
  cwind size proportional to the network state rather than being too
  aggressive or too passive(existing older congestion control algorithms).

* TLS False start is similar to TCP Fast Open in the sense that it
  tries to save one RTT by sending data even before a TLS handshake is
  complete.

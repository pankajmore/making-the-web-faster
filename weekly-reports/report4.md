# Summary

The paper describes about VL2, a network architecture to scale huge
data centers with support for uniform high capacity between servers,
performance isolation between services and Ethernet Layer-2
semantics. Its design is driven by data collected from traffic and
error logs for large cloud services. It can be easily deployed since
it works on top of existing hardware and does not require any new
hardware stack. The efficiency it achieves is 10X compared to
traditional data center architectures without any extra increment in
cost or other trade-offs.
